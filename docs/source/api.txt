To get the most out of Buildcloth, you should have a firm grasp of
build automation in general. If you're using buildcloth as a metabuild
system, a familiarity with the underlying build tool and its syntax
may be helpful, in particular. For more information consider:

- The `GNU Make Manual <http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html>`_

- The `ninja documentation <http://martine.github.com/ninja/manual.html>`_

Additional :doc:`buildcloth tutorial </tutorial>` provide a good
introduction to basic buildcloth use.

As a metabuild tool, Buildcloth has no dependencies outside of the
Python standard library and the build-dependency on `nose`_ for to run
unit tests. As a build tool, buildcloth depends optionally on PyYAML.
