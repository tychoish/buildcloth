To get the most out of Buildcloth, you should have a firm grasp of
build automation in general and your build system's syntax, in
particular. For more information consider: 

- The `GNU Make Manual <http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html>`_
  
- The `ninja documentation <http://martine.github.com/ninja/manual.html>`_

Additional :doc:`buildcloth tutorial </tutorial>` provide a good
introduction to basic buildcloth use.

Buildcloth has no dependencies outside of the Python standard library
and the build-dependency on `nose`_ for to run unit tests.
