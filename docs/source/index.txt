Buildcloth, a Build System Generator
====================================

Buildcloth is a Python library for specifying and maintaining build
system descriptions (e.g. :term:`Makefile` and :term:`ninja.build`
files,) using to encode build logic and generation. Buildcloth is
great for projects that:

  in a build system's own syntax *but* don't want to implement a
  custom build automation tool.

- want to integrate components and data from Python applications or
  other data sources without needing to maintain cumbersome and
  redundant build scripts.

- want to use familiar unit testing tools to ensure correctness for
  build systems.
