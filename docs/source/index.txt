Buildcloth, a Build System Generator
====================================

.. default-domain:: javascript

Buildcloth is a Python library for specifying build systems. You can
think of Buildcloth as a meta-build toolkit, but it's really about
defining and maintaining complex multi-stage processes as easily as
possible. There are three different tools in the buildcloth toolkit:

- Simple procedural interfaces for generating build system definition
  files for `Make`_ and `Ninja`_, in easy to use Python.

- A higher level cross-tool abstraction layer for specifying
  build-rules that you can use to generate :term:`Makefile` and
  :term:`ninja.build` output.

- A simple stage-based Python tool for defining and running concurrent
  (i.e. multiprocessing) Python-based build systems with minimal
  overhead.

Although these components are distinct and are available for
independent use, they provide a basis for building and combining
ad-hoc tools to orchestrate and implement build systems, without
risking insanity or fragility.
